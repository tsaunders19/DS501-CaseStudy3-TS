## Body Fat Prediction Model 
Author: Tiffany Saunders

The datset "Body Fat Prediction" was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/body-fat-prediction-dataset/data) for use in this shiny application. This data set includes several measurements such as bodyfat, density, and the  circumferences of various body parts. A linear regression machine learning model was used to predict the bodyfat using th efeatures that were correlated highly with bodyfat. The root mean square error of prediction and coefficient of determination were calculated to evaluate the models. The model was also applied to whole data set along with some different age groups. 

In the Shiny Application the user can toggle between age group options to see the plot of the two models and the calculated error values.
